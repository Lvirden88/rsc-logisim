# RSC – Register-Set Computer

This project implements a Register-Set Computer (RSC) using Logisim-evolution.

## Features
- Custom datapath and bus architecture
- ALU with arithmetic and logic operations
- Control unit with microcode
- Clocked execution and step-by-step debugging

## How to open
1. Install Logisim-evolution
2. Open `logisim/RSC.circ`
3. Enable ticks or manual clocking

## Project Structure
- `logisim/` – circuit files (.circ)
- `microcode/` – control signals / tables
- `docs/` – screenshots and notes
